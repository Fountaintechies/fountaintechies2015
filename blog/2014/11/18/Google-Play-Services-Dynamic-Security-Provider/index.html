Services Dynamic Security Provider</h2><p>Recently, <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html">Google Play Services</a> 5.0 was released <sup id="fnref1"><a href="index.html#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and among the big list of API changes and new features we also found a <strong>Dynamic Security Provider</strong>.<br> The intention here is that apps can now use this API to install a dynamic security provider, which then acts as a replacement for the platform's bundled secure networking APIs. The benefit is that this <strong>Play Services Security Provider can be updated frequently by Google, which should lead to a rapid delivery of security patches</strong>.</p><p>But before taking a look into this Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider and how it can be used in your own applications, let's take a step back and refresh the security provider model used on Android, and how this Dynamic Security Provider relates to the one bundled with the platform.</p><h2 id="android-security-provider">Android Security Provider</h2><p>Android builds on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Cryptography_Architecture"><em>Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)</em></a> <sup id="fnref2"><a href="index.html#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which, very bluntly summarized, is a set of interfaces to common cryptographic primitives/algorithms.<br> Since JCA has been architected in a way to provide implementation independence and extensibility, implementation happens through a <em>provider</em>-based archtecture. A <em>Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP)</em> <sup id="fnref3"><a href="index.html#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> implements one or more of the cryptographic services (like digital signature algorithms, key generation algorithms, ...). The provider registers the algorithms it implements, so that there is a JCA registry of providers with their supported algorithms.<br> An application will then use the JCA API to specify the wanted algorithm, and depending on its registry, JCA will give it an implementation from one of the loaded providers. <img src="../../../../../images/blogs/android-security-provider/jca.png" alt="Configuration view"></p><p>JCA allows for static and dynamic registration of a security provider, and as such it's possible to add a security provider at run-time (for use in your own application only) with the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Security.html#addProvider(java.security.Provider)">Security.addProvider()</a> and <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Security.html#insertProviderAt(java.security.Provider,%20int)">Security.insertProviderAt()</a> methods.</p><blockquote><p>As an example, this is how you could for instance add the <a href="https://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/">Spongy Castle (repackage of Bouncy Castle)</a> Security Provider, and ensure it is used in preference to other security providers:</p></blockquote><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">static</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div><p>A more elaborate JCA overview would lead us too far for this post, but a thorough examination of the Android Cryptographic Providers can be found in the <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/androidsecurity">Android Security Internals</a> book by Nikolay Elenkov (No Starch Press).</p><h2 id="use-the-google-play-services-dynamic-security-provider">Use the Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider</h2><p>Now on to using this Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider in our own applications.</p><p>First of all, Google Play Services needs to be setup for your project if that is not yet the case. The necessary setup information can be found in <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html">the documentation</a>, and basically boils down to adding the Google Play Services API as a dependency.</p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">apply</span> <span class="nx">plugin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">'android'</span>

This Provider is part of the Google Play Services package, and failure to 'install' this Provider will thus mostly be related to <em>a failure with Google Play Services</em>, namely the unavailability of the library, or the presence of a too old version.</p><p><strong>Google Play Services updates are delivered through the Google Play Store app</strong>. But updates might not reach all users immediately, or the user might have a device without the Google Play Store, and as such it might be worthwile to check for a compatible Google Play Services version when your application first launches, since the presence of the security provider is important for the good working of your application.<br> The Google Play Services library includes <strong>utility methods to determine whether or not the Google Play Services version on the device supports the version of the client library that your application wants to use</strong>. With these utility methods it's also possible, when you detect that the version on the device is too old, to take the user to the Google Play Store in order to install the recent version of the Google Play Services.</p><blockquote><p>The user then gets a Dialog which opens the Google Play Store for an update of the Google Play Services library <img src="../../../../../images/blogs/android-security-provider/device-install-failure-blurred-small.png" alt="Google Play Services update"></p></blockquote><p>For people accustomed to working with the Google Play Services library, failure to install the Dynamic Security Provider is handled as elsewhere in the library.<br> You can <strong>verify the Google Play Services version</strong> with a call to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/GooglePlayServicesUtil.html#isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(android.content.Context)">isGooglePlayServicesAvailable</a>. If the result code is <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/ConnectionResult.html#SUCCESS"><em>SUCCESS</em></a>, then the Google Play Services APK is up-to-date and can be used.<br> For usage in the <em>onProviderInstallFailed</em> callback, either you can use the returned <em>errorCode</em> with a standard resolving UI provided by <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/common/GooglePlayServicesUtil.html">GooglePlayServicesUtil</a>, or you can use the returned <em>recoveryIntent</em> to implement your own custom UI.</p><h3 id="verify-'gmscore_openssl'-usage">Verify 'GmsCore_OpenSSL' usage</h3><p>Now, let's take a look into an application, and verify that this Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider is actually in use.<br> For that purpose I've made a small Android application that lists the Security Providers.

For this reason the usage of a custom Provider was already quite prevalent, and can be seen demonstrated in the aforementioned Bouncy Castle / Spongy Castle example.<br> But this could of course be well <strong>simplified if we could rely on an always-up-to-date Security Provider</strong>, that is updated outside of the platform itself.<br> <strong>A version of <em>Conscrypt</em> is now included with Google Play Services</strong>, where the native library is bundled in the GMS app-lib directory, so that applications that use this new Provider can automatically get the newest version when GMS is upgraded.</p><p>What remains now is to take a look into the algorithms that are available in this Provider, and that can easily be done with a call to the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Provider.html#getServices()">Provider.getServices()</a> method.</p><blockquote><p>We can add a screen to our test application, and check the Services that are available in this new Provider:</p><p><img src="../../../../../images/blogs/android-security-provider/device-gmscore-services-small.png" alt="Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider services"></p></blockquote><p>The following engine classes and algorithms are supported by this Google Play Services Dynamic Security Provider:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Engine Class</th><th>Algorithm</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CertificateFactory      </td><td>X509</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>Cipher</td><td>ARC4<br/>AES/CBC/NoPadding<br/>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding<br/>AES/CFB/NoPadding<br/>AES/CTR/NoPadding<br/>AES/ECB/NoPadding<br/>AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding<br/>AES/OFB/NoPadding<br/>DESEDE/ECB/NoPadding<br/>DESEDE/ECB/PKCS5Padding<br/>DESEDE/CBC/NoPadding<br/>DESEDE/CBC/PKCS5Padding<br/>DESEDE/CFB/NoPadding<br/>DESEDE/OFB/NoPadding<br/>RSA/ECB/NoPadding<br/>RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>KeyAgreement</td><td>ECDH</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>KeyFactory</td><td>DH<br/>DSA<br/>EC<br/>RSA</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>KeyPairGenerator</td><td>DH<br/>DSA<br/>EC<br/>RSA</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>Mac</td><td>HmacMD5<br/>HmacSHA1<br/>HmacSHA224<br/>HmacSHA256<br/>HmacSHA384<br/>HmacSHA512</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>MessageDigest</td><td>MD5<br/>SHA-1<br/>SHA-224<br/>SHA-256<br/>SHA-384<br/>SHA-512</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>SecureRandom</td><td>SHA1PRNG</td></tr><tr><td>____________________</td><td>____________________</td></tr><tr><td>Signature</td><td>ECDSA<br/>MD5WithRSA<br/>NONEwithRSA<br/>SHA1WithRSA<br/>SHA224WithRSA<br/>SHA256WithRSA<br/>SHA384WithRSA<br/>SHA512WithRSA<br/>SHA1withDSA<br/>SHA224withECDSA<br/>SHA256withECDSA<br/>SHA384withECDSA<br/>SHA512withECDSA</td></tr></tbody></table><p>[GmsCore_OpenSSL Provider detail]</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Android relies on the Java Cryptography Architecture, and as such has several Security Providers installed.
