                                      <h2>What We Do</h2>
                                      <p>We specialize in custom web and mobile development, built on strong foundations such as HTML5, AngularJS and ionic. The usage of hybrid frameworks such as ionic enables us to simultaneously design apps for Apple iOS, Google Android as well as Windows Phone, at affordable rates. Since our process is using standard technologies robustness, compatibility and extensibility are ensured now and in the future.</p><br/>

                                      <h2>How We Do It</h2>
                                      <p>At all times, we focus on what is important for you. We are working side by side with you, keeping in touch at all times, leaving the standard business and client relationship behind, achieving far more by being partners. So you will always know, how your project is progressing and what the next milestones will be. When we work together it is important that you know how we work. In order to ensure a systematic approach that results in high quality, reduces unnecessary rework, and efficient  development of your software we are using the unified process. The Unified Process is a software development process, which is a generalized set of activities needed to transform your requirements into a software system. The Unified Process uses the Unified Modelling Language (UML) when preparing the blueprints of the software system.</p><br/>

                                      <h2>The Four Phases</h2>
                                      <p><strong>Inception</strong><br/>In your case, the inquiry as well as the preliminary description of the project mark the first step of the unified process. Together we will develop a vision of the system, outlining the use cases as well as establish the scope of the project in terms of key requirements and boundaries - ensuring that everyone is on the same page right from the start.</p>
                                      <p><strong>Elaboration</strong><br/>The next phase will focus on detailed description of the respective use cases and the graphical modelling of the same. Since the elaboration phase sets the basis for the further development of the actual solution, it is critical that all use cases are described and modelled the way you expect the software to work. For this purpose we will schedule meetings with you at least every 4 days, giving you the latest updates on the progress and the opportunity to request changes, if something shouldn’t be the way you expected it.</p>
                                      <p><strong>Construction</strong><br/>As soon as all use cases are modelled, described and approved by you, the real construction of the software will begin. Our team will develop feature by feature. Each feature will then be tested. This incremental approach ensures the stability and robustness of the software, since errors can be traced back to specific elements. After reaching an internally defined milestone for the software development, you will be receiving a new version of the product - giving you the ability to test it extensibly.</p>
                                      <p><strong>Transition</strong><br/>After the final milestone will be reached the product will be handed to you for further testing. As we strive for great usability in our products, this first release of the software should ideally tested with real users, the feedback gained from this pilot will then start the refinement process that further enhances the user experience with the solution provided.</p>
